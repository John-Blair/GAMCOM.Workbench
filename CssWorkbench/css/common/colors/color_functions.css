 *  =========================================================================== 
 *
 *  less mixin functions to produce colours with IE-safe fallbacks
 *  proper browsers, which support opacity, get a value like rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) 
 *
 *  how:
 *  the mixin function creates two properties, the first with no opacity (this is what IE will use)
 *  the second value is what the sensible browser will use, IE will ignore it because it won't understand the colour definition
